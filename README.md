Pastry
======

A small cross-platform utility which allows you to share your clipboard across all of your devices.

**Pastry currently only works with plain text, copying files will not work yet.**

##Usage
###Desktop
Run "pastry.py" under Python 3. When you first use pastry it will ask you to pick an ID. All devices running pastry with your ID get your clipboard.
